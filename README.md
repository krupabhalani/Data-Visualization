# Data-Visualization

The COVID-19 Data Visualization Dashboard is a Python-based project aimed at providing insightful visualizations of COVID-19 statistics on a country-wise basis. In the wake of the global pandemic, understanding and visualizing the spread of the virus and its impact is crucial for both researchers and the general public. This project offers a user-friendly interface to explore and analyze COVID-19 data visually.

The project consists of two main Python scripts:

co.py: This script performs data analysis and visualization. It reads COVID-19 data from a CSV file (covid.csv) and generates various plots, including line plots and scatter plots, to represent trends in confirmed cases and deaths across different countries.
sc.py: This script displays the generated plots in a Tkinter-based graphical user interface (GUI) with scrolling functionality. Users can scroll through the plots to view them conveniently.

The project utilizes a sample dataset (covid.csv) containing COVID-19 statistics, including the number of confirmed cases and deaths, categorized by country. The dataset serves as the basis for generating the visualizations.
